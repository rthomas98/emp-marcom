## Sample Rewrite - Full Section

### Before:
"As a specialized micro agency, Empuls3 delivers personalized software development and IT consulting services with direct access to our senior specialists."

### After:
"Look, we get it. You've been burned before. Some agency promised the moon, delivered garbage, then sent you a massive invoice.

We're different. How? Simple:
- You work directly with developers who've been coding for 15+ years
- We work remotely, so you're not paying for some fancy office
- We answer our phones (radical concept, right?)
- If we can't fix it, we don't take your money

No junior developers 'learning' on your project. No account managers who can't spell API. Just experienced pros who fix problems fast."
