# ClientPulse - Agency Client Retention AI Platform
*Predict client churn before it happens. Save relationships worth $50K+ each.*

## Executive Summary

ClientPulse is an AI-powered SaaS platform that analyzes communication patterns, project data, and engagement metrics to predict which agency clients are at risk of churning. By identifying at-risk accounts 30-60 days before they leave, agencies can take proactive steps to save relationships worth tens of thousands in recurring revenue.

**Target Market**: Digital agencies, marketing agencies, creative agencies, PR firms, consulting firms
**Price Point**: $199-499/month based on client count
**Core Value**: Turn reactive client management into proactive relationship saving

---

## Problem Statement

### The $50K+ Problem
- Agencies lose 20-30% of clients annually
- Average agency client worth $5-10K/month
- By the time client says "we need to talk," it's too late
- Current "health scores" are manual guesswork
- Account managers miss early warning signs
- No systematic way to track relationship degradation

### Why Current Solutions Fail
- Generic churn tools (ChurnZero, Gainsight) built for SaaS, not services
- CRMs track activities, not relationship quality
- Project management tools miss emotional indicators
- Manual check-ins happen too late
- No pattern recognition across lost accounts

---

## Solution Overview

ClientPulse uses AI to analyze:
- **Email sentiment** (tone getting shorter/colder)
- **Response times** (delays indicating disengagement)
- **Meeting patterns** (cancellations, no-shows, shortened calls)
- **Project velocity** (slowing approvals, delayed feedback)
- **Payment behavior** (late payments, payment disputes)
- **Stakeholder changes** (new decision makers, champion departure)

The AI learns from your agency's specific patterns and provides:
- 30-60 day advance warning of churn risk
- Specific reasons for risk (e.g., "Email sentiment declined 40% over 2 weeks")
- Recommended interventions based on what saved similar clients
- Automated alerts to account managers

### Smart Cost Optimization
```javascript
// Two-tier analysis approach
async analyzeClient(clientId) {
  // Tier 1: Rule-based (FREE)
  const quickRisk = {
    slowResponse: avgResponseTime > 48,
    decliningFreq: emailTrend < -0.3,
    missedMeetings: noShowRate > 0.2,
    latePayments: avgDaysLate > 10
  };
  
  const riskScore = calculateScore(quickRisk);
  
  // Tier 2: AI only for at-risk (>40 score)
  if (riskScore > 40) {
    return await groqDeepAnalysis(clientData);
  }
  
  return quickRisk;
}
```
